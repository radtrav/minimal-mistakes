Hey! I'm Travis, a passionate full stack web developer constantly trying to keep up with ever changing web technologies such as Node, React, Angular and Redux. I also have experience developing numerical simulations. You can check out some of my open source projects on my github. Outside of programming I love learning (human) languages. I am currently improving my French, Japanese, Spanish and Portuguese!

I have written a few tech based blog posts, mostly for my own usage; to document my experiences as well as solidify programming and CS concepts.
