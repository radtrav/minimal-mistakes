We decided to use the zoom api for our video conferencing needs.

We need to take video conferencing out of the browser because of the chrome bug that I outlined in my previous blog post.

I have used codementor.com which uses the api in the past and was quite impressed. Seeing how cleanly this was implemented was the inspiration for proposing this as a solution to our dilemma.

The api itself is quite easy to use and simple to set up. The trickiest part is figuring out how to create reminders to be sent from our backend once a meeting is scheduled to start. Perhaps in another post I will describe how I went about setting up scheduled (and cancellable) reminders on our backend server.
